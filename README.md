# Python Bike List
I built this program as a first year python project for CSSE1001 at the University of Queensland.  It demonstrates my understanding of python syntax and ability to create a simple GUI.

## What does it do?
It has the ability to load a CSV file containing the information you see above.  You can create a new part, and create a new compound part, make of parts.  When creating a compound part you need to follow the given syntax.
`VH139:2,TR102:1` would create a compound part with 2 VH139 and 1 TR102.
